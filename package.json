  "description": "In this Philadelphia-themed game, a user is given underscores on the UI indicating letters of a Philadelphia related word(s)-to-guess. Each time the user presses a letter, it displays under \"Your guesses so far:\". If the letter is in the word(s)-to-guess, it will replace the underscore. If the letter is not in the word(s)-to-guess, it will decrease their number of wrong guesses left by 1. After 5 wrong guesses, the user loses - An alert is displayed, the correct word(s)-to-guess is(are) displayed and the game restarts automatically. If the user guesses all letters correctly, they win the game - A snippet of the Rocky Theme Song then plays and the game restarts automatically. Wins and losses are kept track on the UI.",
